# Bad Usb
BadUSB is an attack that exploits an inherent vulnerability in USB firmware. Such an attack reprograms a USB device, 
causing it to act as a human interface device; once re-engineered,
the USB device is used to discreetly execute commands or run malicious programs on the victim's computer.
