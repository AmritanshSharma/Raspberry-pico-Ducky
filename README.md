# Bad Usb
BadUSB is an attack that exploits an inherent vulnerability in USB firmware. Such an attack reprograms a USB device, 
causing it to act as a human interface device; once re-engineered,
the USB device is used to discreetly execute commands or run malicious programs on the victim's computer.

# HID

The term "HID" most commonly refers to the USB-HID specification. The term was coined
by Mike Van Flandern of Microsoft when he proposed that the USB committee create a
Human Input Device class working group.The working group was renamed as the Human
Interface Device class at the suggestion of Tom Schmidt of DEC because the proposed standard 
supported bi-directional communication
